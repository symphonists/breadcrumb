# Breadcrumb

- Version: 1.1
- Date: July 3rd, 2011
- Author: Alistair Kearney (alistair@symphony21.com); Solutions Nitriques (open-source (at) nitriques.com)
- Requirements: Symphony 2.2+

Includes a Data Source that, based on the current page, will provide a focused XML structure representing the parent hierarchy. It is more efficient than a conventional Navigation DS, since there is less redundant data and is much easier to traverse with XPath.

## Installation

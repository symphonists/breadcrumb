Breadcrumb
------------------------------------

Version: 1.1
Author: Alistair Kearney (alistair@symphony21.com); Solutions Nitriques (open-source (at) nitriques.com)
Build Date: 2011-07-03
Requirements: Latest Symphony 2 build

Includes a Data Source that, based on the current page, will provide a focused XML structure representing the
parent hierarchy. It is more efficient than a conventional Navigation DS, since there is less redundant data
and is much easier to traverse with xpath.


[REQUIREMENTS]

- Latest Symphony 2 build
- Compatible with the Multilangual Field and Language Redirect extensions
